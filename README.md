# Game Overview
This is the first Unity project I started, and it is a process of learning and growing many technical elements.

Optimization overview
 - When using coroutines, new WaitForSeconds() is a class, so it was cached and used.
 - Only the UI component that needs to handle the event has enabled the setting of 'Raycast Target'.
 - I set force to mono for each audio clip.
 - The string was used by setting it as a runtime constant.
 - I created Debug as a global class and set the Log global function so that Debug.Log() can be used.
